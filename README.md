# JavaScript Custom Form Validation

## Overview

Practice problem for the JavaScript section of The Odin Project (https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/javascript-form-validation-with-javascript). 

The problem was to build a browser form which collects Email, Country, Zip Code, Password, and Password Confirmation fields and JavaScript to validate the user response. JavaScript is used twice, once to validate user input as the user provides a respond to the field and then another time on submit to ensure the form is complete before submitting.

In this example the form is not actually submit but a message will appear if the form has met all of the requirements.
